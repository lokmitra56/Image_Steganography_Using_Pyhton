# Image_Steganography_Using_Python
## Hiding text messages or image in an image without altering its appearanc

#### 1) Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone can not know the presence or contents of the hidden message.

#### 2) The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that a message is communicated.

#### 3) Although steganography differs from cryptography, there are many analogies between the two, and some authors classify steganography as a form of cryptography since hidden communication is a type of secret message.

#### 4) The secret can be in the form of a text or in the form of an image(i.e Hiding Text inside an Image or hiding Image inside an Image)

## Advantage Over Cryptography
#### 1) The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny.

#### 2) Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.
